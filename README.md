<h1 align="center">Install</h1>
<p align="center">
  <ol>
    <li>Install python and pip as detailed <a href="https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/">here</a></li>
    <li>Once both Python >= 3 and PIP are installed, you can install the required libraries from the <code>requirements.txt</code> file as follows.</li>
    <pre><code language="bash">
      $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    </code></pre>
  </ol>
</p>

<br />

<h1 align="center">Setup/Getting Started</h1>
<p align="center">
  <ol>
    <li>First, <code>cd</code> into the <code>bin</code> directory of the program as follows:</li>
    <pre><code language="bash">
      $ cd path/to/SqueaPyCleanSpotify-main/bin
    </code></pre>
    <li>Next, run the <code>./main</code> file with the arguments you would like. A list of accepted arguments is compiled below.</li>
    <pre><code language="bash">
      $ ./main [FULL_URL_TO_YOUR_PLAYLIST/the word "credentials" (for changing login info)]
    </pre></code>
    <li>If you did everything right, you should be redirected to an Auth Page to verify the program's rights, and then the SqueaPyCleanSpotify CLI should tell you what it's doing!</li>
  </ol>
